-----

# Used Concepts
- Layered architecture
- Qt Creator for GUI
- Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Observer pattern
- MVC pattern

---

# Functionalities
- The application can have multiple programmers.
- The data about the programmers is read from a text file at the start of the program.
- Each window has the name of its user.
- Each programmer can see the revised and not-revised files.
- Each programmer can add a new file for revising.
- Each programmer can revise only the files which were not created by him/her.
- The files can be sorted by the name, the creator, the reviewer or by the status (revised/not-revised).
- There exists a Statistics Window, where each programmer is represented as a circle, with the radius proportional with the number of files he/she revised.
- Each programmer has a goal number of file he/she wants to revise.
- When that goal is achived, on the status Window, the circle for that programmer will become blue.
